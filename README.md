# SecCertRoadmapHTML
Security Certification Roadmap HTML5/CSS3 version

This code is embedded inside the html page at https://www.pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/

I am open to restructing this html if a better way is known. I am a beginner at best when it comes to HTML and CSS.

## Known Issues:
1. Certifications do not line up with frames exactly depending on windows size. This is especially noticable on resolutions above 1920x1080.
2. Some certifications need updated linked and/or exam prices.
